      <h1>Dates in Stars</h1>

    <p> <p>This will be a tiny post, but there is a Federation standard for how dates are written.</p>

<p>The current stardate, as of writing this, is 1302.6.7. 1302 is the “year”, 6 is the “week” (which is actually 10 days, and there are 10 “weeks” in a year), and 7 is day.</p>

<p>A day is about 24 hours but I (the GM) don’t really care about tracking time on a level lower than that - I just mark when I think a day has gone by.</p>
