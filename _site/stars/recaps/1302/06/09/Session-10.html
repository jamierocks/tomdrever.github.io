    <p> <p>(Another short recap because nobody missed the session (wow!))</p>

<p>The players successfully rescued Blue from the SansheCorp Holding Facilty, with the help of the Carpenter. Unfortunately, they lost Tak along the way, but managed to manuever the ship to the facility in time to escape. They returned briefly to the street, delivering Viktor, his weapons, and Captain Keltran. They tased Keltran on the way out as he seemed to have beef with Mr Janssen, the man who had got them the ship license.</p>

<p>They hopped back to Daedylus, refueled and waited for the jump freighter to take them back to Valhallan Rho.</p>

<p>Which it did.</p>

<p>The end.</p>
