    <p> <p>The players started in the underground fighting ring on Polymele, in the Diecoon system. They find a reasonably cheap hotel in the area
and stay there for the night. In the morning, they briefly return to the underground where they are greeted by a couple of cleaners 
tidying up after last night’s raucous events. The players are told that the ring will be closing for a few days but will open for 
another event shortly. The players then leave the city, taking a public shuttle back out to the military base where their ship is
currently docked.</p>

<p>On the journey between Diecoon and Polyxena, Tak reads a message from his family revealing that his mother is being moved to another 
drug treatment and will require another 1000 credits before the year is up (in about 50 days). Diamond looks further into the jump gate 
disaster he saw on the news on Polymele. There is not much to the story: the general secretary Typhon Gearsmith has issued a public statement about the 
sudden collapse of the jump gate in Holto, sealing the Holto sector off from the rest of the galaxy until another link is established. In
other news he reads about a recent sociological development published by a professor on the Madhav Scientific Council university of Sperev, in 
Katla. Additionally, Tak spends some time using the ship’s computer system, training his “Program” skill and notices that the properties 
of some news files have become corrupted, seemingly incorrectly modified when a user read them.</p>

<p>Nothing much occurs in Polyxena; the players dock in the partially constructed XenaStationTM and they meet with the local trade 
official, a Gessuran named Hytra (I think). She walks with Tak for a bit in one of the artificial plex-domed landscapes and they sign
the necessary documents, transfer the remaining credits and organise the extraction of their cargo, some basic suppies Tak was carrying for them.</p>

<p>The players leave and jump to Onassis, the final stop in this sector. During the jump most of the players spend time training and Tak 
looks some more at the corrupted files, ascertaining that they are not being modified by any of the existing user profiles but that 
it is also not an external force. They arrive at Onassis Outpost, a tiny circular orbital station about half the size of Blue’s ship. The 
majority of the station is a “restaurant-at-the-end-of-the-universe” style circular bar, nameless except for an “Infinity” sign, with a couple of admin
rooms and some engine rooms beneath. Blue goes straight to the bar and asks to speak with some sort of tech support. The robot bartender contacts the 
station’s tech guy, a bulky Gessuran man, who checks the ship’s hardware and reveals there is no fault there. He promises to contact a 
comp tech friend of his and gives Blue his compad number. Diamond also inquires about some bodyguard work at the bar and the Gessuran says he’ll 
get back to him. When the players return to the bar, another Gessuran, a pilot-looking woman who introduces herself as Gestra, beelines for Tak and 
asks him to sit with her over a drink at the bar. Diamond notices a pair of leather-clad helmeted bodyguards sitting at the table Gestra 
left and he and Blue go to sit with them, weapons readied.</p>

<p>Gestra reveals she is a fellow merchant, working on behalf of a client on Thorgunnav (a planet in the Rati system), a collector of sorts
who is interested in the cargo Tak and Blue are currently carrying. She offers Tak 10,000 credits on the spot if they take the cargo 
back to Rati. Tak is hesitant and pushes for more information but Gestra lets out very little, other than that her client is a
specialist collector of unique “technology”. When it seems Tak is not up for the deal, Gestra draws her two monoblades and indicates
that she is willing to take the cargo by force. Blue immediately runs one of the bodyguards through with his sword and Diamond unloads
his Vortex Cannon on Gestra. The other bodyguard is also harmed in the scuffle. The players find a credstick with 10,000 credits loaded 
on Gestra’s horrifically mutilated body. The players return to the ship, with the unconscious second bodyguard, after apologising to the
bartenders and paying (some) damages.</p>

<p>Back on the ship the helmeted guard is revealed to be a Lura named Kila, a mercenary who was hired alongside her twin sister (Kala) 
to protect Gestra. She is not too happy with the situation but recognises that she is lucky to have been left alive and will have to 
find a place to stay wherever they drop her off. Shortly after all this the jump freighter signals to Blue’s ship that they can board.</p>

<p>The players park the ship inside the freighter and exit, ready for the sector jump. They are sharing the freighter with a small 
but long military ship of unknown origin with a largely Quelin crew. The players mostly stay in cabins in the freighter for the 
5-day sector jump, a relatively uneventful journey. They try to press Kila for information but it seems she knows very little about this 
specific job and is possibly a little bit peeved at the death of her sister.</p>

<p>They leave the freighter outside the jump gate in the first system in Fellan Rho, the Daedalus system. The coordinates for Tak’s trade 
lead to a small stormy planet called Charybdis. The players land in a seemingly abandoned ship dock, with a partially destroyed 
administration centre. There is a strong sea breeze from a nearby shoreline. They can see a small lighthouse-like building on
a nearby cliff but before they can set off 3 large panther-like beasts skulk into the ship park. They seem to emit some sort of hallucinogenic or 
light-bending gas that makes them appear to jump and jitter around as they move at a rapid pace towards Blue and Diamond. During the fight Diamond is nearly
killed but is revived by Tak, and Diamond and Blue manage to eventually slay all 3 beasts. After resting for a short while in the ship’s medbay,
the trio make their way up the path to the lighthouse. A large burly human man who introduces himself as Grigori opens the door, letting them into the 
small building. Confirming they are here to exchange Tak’s cargo he offers them some space tea and asks them about their journey. Making
polite conversation, the players describe the technical issues they’ve been having with the ship (corrupted file data, etc). At this 
Grigori becomes very sad and explains in a typically villainous way that he’s going to have to kill them. He locks down the house but 
with Diamond’s Vortex Cannon he is quite easily overpowered. Having been nearly killed by the plasma-propelled shrapnel he is a babbling 
mess when they press him for answers. He eventually breaks free of Blue’s grapple and knocks himself out using his wrist implant. The 
players check the body, finding in pistol, a small knife, a type A energy cell, another 10,000 credit credstick and a nanobot tattoo on 
his other wrist of a bracelet with the words “Order from/of/at Valhalla” written in an archaic language. His cybernetic wrist implant is 
of very high quality; it has short-ranged communication, intravenous drug administration and a basic Field Emitter (similar to
Blue’s). His unconscious body is taken back to the ship. Diamond looks upstairs and finds some long-range comms tech and a large digital 
storage device. He takes the SSD and leaves. With another few days until they can leave the sector, the players begin to make their way
to the Icarus system. During this time they decide to check what the cargo they still have actually is. Slashing through the tough 
wrappings they reveal a large black box, made of a thick radiation/transmission blocking material. In the top corner of one of the sides 
they see the letter “C” indented into the material.</p>

<p>The session ended with Tak, Blue and Diamond taking their downtime actions while travelling to Icarus. Tak spent some more time with 
the computer system and we finished with a small command line popping up bearing the word “Hello?”.</p>
