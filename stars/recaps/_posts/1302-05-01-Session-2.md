Starting in orbit of Malenhavn Central Port, the players went to Razioff, in Arrieta (1 ½ days travel). They stayed here while their ship was refuelled, spending about 6 hours in colony segment alpha, a civilian segment, though they arrived at a military intelligence base in segment delta monitoring the nearby dyson sphere construction site. Tak and Blue went to the Main Dome, a high-class shopping-centre-like area full of parks and complex sculptures and shops. Tak acquired some more cargo from the trade centre, then the pair spent a while milling around for a bit. Blue decided to challenge the (majority elderly business-person) public to a fight and attracted some security guards but Tak defused the situation. Ystra, Diamond and Kee’dow went to the lower-class markets. Kee got some work fixing an engine for a scummy tech dealer, Ystra worked in a strip bar and Diamond offered his services as a bodyguard to the adjacent tavern, where some officious-looking Aandrisks and Gessurans were having a meeting. (¼ of a day)

Then they flew to Polymele, in Diecoon (3 days travel). They landed at a commercial spaceport first, took a jeep into a small town, (unsuccessfully) inquired about refuge for Ystra then went back and flew to a military base somewhere else on the planet, where they docked and got cheap drillfuel. A longboye swarm was due so they had to wait a day before they could return to the base or their ship. They took a shuttle into a nearby city and immediately headed to the underground. Kee found some tech dealers to chat with and bought some spare parts, while Tak, Diamond, Blue and Ystra went to an illegal fighting ring where local heroes are put against longboyes. Blue fought in the ring and had stunning success against a standard longboye and the others won considerable credits betting on him. He gained much respect as a complete unknown, and a tech trader from upstairs came down to persuade him to join as his mascot, in exchange for cybernetically enhanced fists, though Blue turned him down for now. The organisers of the ring (a Quelin couple) also spoke to him and said he could have a go with a larger specimen in the afternoon, a mile-longboye. Tak, Kee, Diamond and Ystra place more bets and drink for a bit in the underground bar. On the news they hear about a Jump Gate Disaster in Holto (another sector) and learn that the scavenger captain they defeated on Malen Central Port was a member of the Steppe Union. Blue is crushed in the fight with the mile-longboye but is quickly revived by Tak. We finished with Blue being dragged away in a stretcher and the rest of the party following, with the crowd disappointed.
