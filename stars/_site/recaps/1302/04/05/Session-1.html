<p>(I didn’t originally write a recap for this one, but fuck it, we’ll do it live)</p>

<p>The PCs started the game aboard a mass transport freighter taking them across sector. They started in three groups:
Tak and Blue, a merchant and a pirate, transporting possibly-illicit cargo into this new sector; Robert just fucking around; and Diamond as part of a mercenary group being taken to the sector to defend some big construction operation. They messed around the port for like the whole session, noticing the security were looking for some criminal scavenger organisation called the “Steppe Union”. Blue got his ship tagged and had to remove the massive pirate logo, but that’s about it.</p>

<p>Towards the end, as Robert, Blue and Tak were boarding their ships, there was a scuffle with a member of the Steppe who was trying to do something; Diamond rushed to neutralize them, Robert killed a PC, Diamond died, Blue killed the scavengers and I think Tak healed someone? Yeah then the federation mercs agreed to let Diamond take Blue around until Diamond was needed in system 406 and they all flew off into the sunset. Robert was taken away by security and got put in an asylum or something and hE’S OUT OF THE GAME, OK?</p>
