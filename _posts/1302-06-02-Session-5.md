We began the session in the middle of the underground street, people beginning to filter back into their homes after the execution of the Human man Rosalind had referred to as Hadrav. Rosalind, Resh and Victor talked amongst themselves for a bit then Rosalind approached Blue.
She pointed him in the direction of a hacker who could potentially help with their ship-clamped-in-the-port problem. Blue also inquired 
about purchasing new weapons, particularly a sword, and was told to go to the store they had passed through as they left the port and 
entered the street. The criminal crew (Rosalind, Resh and Victor) left in the direction of one of the apartment block/council flat-looking buildings.

The PCs entered the weapons store and Blue began asking the store owner, an older Human lady called Anna Feng, about buying a sword. When 
it transpired that not only did she not sell anything better than _Inazuma_, Blue's current blade of choice, but that the PCs did not even
have any of the currency traded on this planet, a token-like coinage called "Ha'pesh", they left. Ystra then led them to a nightclub 
down the way and managed to purloin some Ha'pesh from the EDM-addled clubbers, while Diamond, Blue and the others watched bemused from
the doorway. 

Next they went to the building Rosalind had suggested they check for her hacker friend. Inside the bunker-like room, with tech and wires
and screens laying around, they met a group of nerds tinkering with machinery and monitors. Two of them, a younger Human girl and an Utun
man, approached them. Blue explained they were looking for someone to hack the terminal in the port to release their ship and was told that
it was certainly possible - the girl, "Ghost", was easily the best hacker in the city - but that they would require payment. A large 
quantity of Ha'pesh, some supplies or scrap tech would do. Blue and Ystra determined they should acquire some food supplies for them and
the Utun agreed to this deal, telling them to go to the local food dispensary and sort it out there.

At the food dispensary - a single room at the corner of the street, with a large table in the middle and a selection of vending machines
and shelves bearing packaged meals - the PCs met a Gessuran man, an operator of the dispensary. He explained to them that the street gets
its food through a company called "EverLife", who deals in the distribution of food, particularly to "less developed" communities such as
this. He goes on, saying that they have tried many times to increase their weekly supply, but that the company has met each request with
denial. Ystra gets talking with another, significantly more shady Gessuran in the room, and acquires 2 contacts - someone who can 
exchange her new Ha'pesh for credits, and a drug dealer. Blue also talked to this other gentleman, and gets a compad number for someone 
he claims sells pretech weaponry.

The PCs then headed "upstairs" to the upper city, which was described as _cyberpunk_dystopia.jpeg_. Tall, black-grey tower blocks, flashing
neon signs and posters, rain, you name it. Eventually the PCs found an EverLife office, managed to bluff their way through reception and into
the meeting rooms and offices of the main building. After some genuinely-pretty-clever social interaction with a tired, late 50s Human
businessman named Richard, Blue managed to get hold of the location of the factory where EverLife processes food for this part of the city.
However, after some less-clever dealings with the guards on the way out, they left having sliced someone in twain and bricking it.

Ystra was up to similar shit at the entrance to a Red Dragon office, where she was trying to find drug farms, I think? IDFK. She didn't kill
anyone, though, and ended up going to the public-library-esque infocentre. We ended the session there.
